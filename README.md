# Simple Flask RESTful API

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a simple RESTful API using Flask (Python) that allows users to manage a collection of movies. The API supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, as well as a filtering mechanism to retrieve movies based on their genre. This project serves as an introductory exercise in understanding how to build and manage RESTful APIs using Flask.

## Key Activities

- **Setting Up the Flask Environment**:
  - Install Flask and set up a basic Flask application.
  - Configure routing and request handling.

- **Implementing CRUD Operations**:
  - **GET**: Retrieve all movies or a specific movie by ID.
  - **POST**: Add a new movie to the collection.
  - **PUT**: Update details of an existing movie by its ID.
  - **DELETE**: Remove a movie from the collection by its ID.

- **Filtering Movies by Genre**:
  - Implement a filter to retrieve movies based on their genre.

- **Running and Testing the API**:
  - Run the Flask application on a local server.
  - Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.

## Technology Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to create the RESTful API.
- **JSON**: Data format used for communication between the client and the server.
